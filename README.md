[LED Colours and quantum physics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2019/07/01/the-mostly-quantum-physics-of-making-colors/?sh=2ce5846e3953) are inextricably linked.
After watching a temperature based LED colour changing demo at questacon, an idea started forming in my head for using a similar idea with LED's of different colours and seeing how they
react spectrally with temperature.

I have also always been a Green Lantern nerd and I have been making lantern rings since 2010. You will probably find some of them in the wild in Hobart among the clientele of various
pubs and nightclubs. This is a more serious attempt at making a piece of electronic jewellery, cosplay prop and nerdy onanism all rolled into one.
