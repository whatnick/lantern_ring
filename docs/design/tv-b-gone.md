# IR TV Turn-off mode
The Infrared LED's in the ring can be used in TV-B-Gone mode to broadcast shutdown signals to devices in range. From TV's to Airconditioning units. Perhaps appropriate for a spooky Halloween effect where someone in a costume can turn devices off by proximity.

Inspired by [Adafruit Kit](https://github.com/adafruit/TV-B-Gone-Kit).

## Main Components
- [InfraRed LED Transmitters]()
- Minimal MCU to broadcast codes
