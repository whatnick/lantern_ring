#### What is it?

Custom made prop/jewellery/cosplay accessory modelled after lantern corp rings from the DC Universe.

#### Why did you make it?

I have always been fascinated by the green lantern ring from reading DC comics of the Green Lanterns and Justice League. When I watched the movie and collected the darkest night brightest day series, this interest solidified. I started making these rings derived from the idea of LED throwies with cut cans providing the body and LED's spanning a coin cell providing the light. As I have gained skills in mechanical and electronics design over the last 10 years, this has morphed into a product I am proud to sell to other fans rather than a novelty I give out in pubs and clubs to make friends.


#### What makes it special?

This lantern rings are 3D printed to the measurements of the wearer on demand and use brightest LED's available within the coin cell voltage limits. They are also fully open-source and follow the logos of all the 10 different lantern variants. Colour variants are available:
- White (Life)
- Black Light/UV (Death)
- Red (Rage)
- Orange (Avarice)
- Yellow (Fear)
- Green (Will)
- Blue (Hope)
- Indigo (Compassion)
- Violet/Pink (Love)
- Invisible/IR
